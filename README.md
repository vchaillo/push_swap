### Description

Through this project, you will have to sort a stack with a limit number of instructions, in as few moves as possible. To succeed, you'll need to use various sorting algorithms and choose the solution(s) most appropriate for a highly optimised data sorting.

### Usage

```

./push swap OPTIONS [NUMBERS TO SORT]
